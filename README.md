# rvemu
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/d0iasm/rvemu.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/d0iasm/rvemu)  

RISC-V online emulator with WebAssembly generated by Rust. The instruction sets in this emulator complies "The RISC-V Instruction Set ManualVolume I: Unprivileged ISADocument Version 20191213".

The online emulator is available here: [rvemu.app](https://rvemu.app/)

Supports the following RISC-V ISA features (RV64G):
- RV32I (v2.1): supports 40/40 instructions (FENCE, ECALL, and EBREAK don't do anything for now)
- RV64I (v2.1): supports 12/12 instructions (SLLI, SRLI, and SRAI are included in RV32I)
- RV32M/RV64M (v2.0): supports 13/13 instructions
- RV32A/RV64A (v2.0): supports 22/22 instructions (no unittests and no atomicity)
- RV32F/RV64F (v2.2): supports 30/30 instructions
- RV32D/RV64D (v2.2): supports 32/32 instructions
- Zifencei (v2.0): supports 1/1 instructions (FENCE.i doesn't do anything for now)
- Zicsr (v2.0): supports 6/6 instructions (no unittests and no atomicity)

__NOTE: This project is currently under intensely development. The source code might be changed dramatically.__
What to do next is:
1. Rewrite tests in assembly
   1. rewrite existing tests
   2. exceptions
2. devices interrupt (refers to
   [memlayout.h](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv/blob/37df68e5dedbf2a26c2bf0bdae090b206ce78b48/kernel/memlayout.h) in xv6)
   1. keyboards
   2. timer
   3. uart
   4. virtio
   5. block devices
3. virtual memory

# Usage
The emulator supports the following commands:
- __upload__: Upload a local RISC-V binary/local RISC-V binaries for an execution on the emulator.
- __ls__: List the files you uploaded.
- __run [file]__: Execute a file.
- __help__: Print all commands you can use.

## Build and Run
The `wasm-pack build` command generates a pkg directory and makes Rust source code into `.wasm` binary. It also generates the JavaScript API for using our Rust-generated WebAssembly. The toolchain's supported target is `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
You need to execute this command whenever you change your Rust code.
```
$ wasm-pack build --out-dir public/pkg --target web
```

This command installs dependencies in the `node_modules` directory. Need `npm install --save` in the `public` directory at the first time and whenever you change dependencies in package.json.
```
$ npm install --save // at the public directory
```

You can see the website via http://localhost:8000. `npm start` is the alias of `python3 -m http.server` so you need Python3 in your environment.
```
$ npm start // at the public directory
```

## Build RISC-V binary
This emulator starts to execute at the address 0, so you need to extract .text section to execute your binary file on the emulator.
```
// Make an assembly file from a C file.
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -S hoge.c -nostdlib
// Make a binary file from an assembly file with start position 0.
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -o hoge hoge.s -Wl,-Ttext=0 -nostdlib
// Extract a text section from a binary file.
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text hoge hoge.text
```

## Test
You need to install a Firefox browser, a Chrome browser, or a Safari browser to test the project. A browser can be specified by a `--firefox` or a `--chrome` flag.
```
$ wasm-pack test --headless --firefox
```

## Debug
It's a tricky way to debug this project. These is no binary to execute in a console because wasm-bindgen usually needs a browser, so use a unit test instead to print messages to a console.
```
$ wasm-pack test --firefox --headless -- --test debug
```

## Publish
[The site](https://rvemu.app/) is hosted by a firebase for now. It might move in the future.
```
$ firebase deploy
```
