RISC-V online emulator with WebAssembly generated by Rust. The emulator implements the standard extensions RV64G (RV64IMAFD) and cimplies with [the RISC-V specifications](https://riscv.org/specifications/).

The online emulator is available here: [**rvemu.app**](https://rvemu.app/)

Supports the following RISC-V ISAs (RV64G):
- RV64I (v2.1): supports 52/52 instructions (FENCE, ECALL, and EBREAK don't do anything for now)
- RV64M (v2.0): supports 13/13 instructions
- RV64A (v2.0): supports 22/22 instructions (No atomicity for now)
- RV64F (v2.2): supports 30/30 instructions
- RV64D (v2.2): supports 32/32 instructions
- Zifencei (v2.0): supports 1/1 instructions (FENCE.i doesn't do anything for now)
- Zicsr (v2.0): supports 6/6 instructions (no unittests and no atomicity)

__NOTE: This project is currently under intensely development. The source code might be changed dramatically.__
What to do next is:
1. devices interrupt (refers to
   [memlayout.h](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv/blob/37df68e5dedbf2a26c2bf0bdae090b206ce78b48/kernel/memlayout.h) in xv6)
   1. keyboards
   2. timer
   3. uart
   4. virtio
   5. block devices
2. virtual memory

# Usage
The emulator supports the following commands:
- __upload__: Upload a local RISC-V binary/local RISC-V binaries for an execution on the emulator.
- __ls__: List the files you uploaded.
- __run [file]__: Execute a file.
- __help__: Print all commands you can use.

## Build and run on the local browser
The `wasm-pack build` command generates a pkg directory and makes Rust source code into `.wasm` binary. It also generates the JavaScript API for using our Rust-generated WebAssembly. The toolchain's supported target is `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
You need to execute this command whenever you change your Rust code.
```
$ make rvemu-wasm
// This is the alias of `wasm-pack build lib/rvemu-wasm --out-dir <path-to-rvemu>/public/pkg --target web`.
```

This command installs dependencies in the `node_modules` directory. Need `npm install --save` in the `public` directory at the first time and whenever you change dependencies in package.json.
```
$ npm install --save // at the public directory
```

You can see the website via http://localhost:8000. `npm start` is the alias of `python3 -m http.server` so you need Python3 in your environment.
```
$ npm start // at the public directory
```

## Build and run as a CLI tool
The emulator can be executed as a CLI tool.
```
$ make rvemu-cli
// This is the alias of `cargo build --release --manifest-path lib/rvemu-cli/Cargo.toml`.
```

The binary file is generated in the target directory.
```
$ ./target/release/rvemu-cli <binary-file-name>
```

## Build RISC-V binary
This emulator starts to execute at the address 0, so you need to extract .text section to execute your binary file on the emulator.
```
// Make an assembly file from a C file.
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -S hoge.c -nostdlib
// Make a binary file from an assembly file with start position 0.
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -o hoge hoge.s -Wl,-Ttext=0 -nostdlib
// Extract a text section from a binary file.
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text hoge hoge.text
```

## Testing
### ISA testing
You can see the binaries for unit testings in [riscv/riscv-tests](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests).
The following command executes all `rv64ua/d/f/i/m-p-*` binaries.
```
$ make test-isa
```

### Testing with WebAssembly
NOTE: This is deprecated bacause I'll delete them in the future. This tests are
implemented in the `lib/rvemu-wasm/tests` directory.

You need to install a Firefox browser, a Chrome browser, or a Safari browser to run the integration testings. A browser can be specified by a `--firefox` or a `--chrome` flag.
```
$ make test-wasm
```

## Publish
[The site](https://rvemu.app/) is hosted by a firebase.
```
$ firebase deploy
```
