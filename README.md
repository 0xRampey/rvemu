RISC-V online emulator with WebAssembly generated by Rust. The emulator implements the standard extensions RV64G (RV64IMAFD, Zicsr, Zifencei) and complies with [the RISC-V specifications](https://riscv.org/specifications/).

The online emulator is available here:
- [**rvemu.app**](https://rvemu.app/): Run a RISC-V binary you uploaded.
- [**rvemu.app/xv6**](https://rvemu.app/xv6.html): Run
  [`xv6`](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv).

Supports the following features:
- [x] RV64G ISAs
  - [x] RV64I (v2.1): supports 52/52 instructions (FENCE, ECALL and EBREAK do nothing for now)
  - [x] RV64M (v2.0): supports 13/13 instructions
  - [x] RV64A (v2.1): supports 22/22 instructions (No atomicity for now)
  - [x] RV64F (v2.2): supports 30/30 instructions
  - [x] RV64D (v2.2): supports 32/32 instructions
  - [x] Zifencei (v2.0): supports 1/1 instructions (FENCE.i does nothing for now)
  - [x] Zicsr (v2.0): supports 6/6 instructions (No atomicity for now)
- [ ] RV64C ISAs
- [x] Privileged ISAs: supports 7/7 instructions (WFI, SFENCE.VMA, HFENCE.BVMA
  and HFENCE.GVMA do nothing for now)
- [x] Control and status registers (CSRs)
  - [x] Machine-level CSRs
  - [x] Supervisor-level CSRs
  - [ ] User-level CSRs
- [x] Virtual memory system (Sv39)
- [x] Devices
  - [x] UART: universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter
  - [x] CLINT: core local interruptor
  - [x] PLIC: platform level interrupt controller
  - [x] Virtio

These features are compliant with "The RISC-V Instruction Set ManualVolume I: Unprivileged ISADocument Version 20191213" and "The RISC-V Instruction Set ManualVolume II: Privileged ArchitectureDocument Version 20190608-Priv-MSU-Ratified".

## Usage
You can run [`xv6`](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv), a simple Unix-like operating system, in [**rvemu.app/xv6**](https://rvemu.app/xv6.html).

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d0iasm/rvemu/master/demo.gif)

You also be able to run an arbitrary RISC-V binary in [**rvemu.app**](https://rvemu.app/). The online emulator supports the following commands:
- __upload__: Upload local RISC-V binaries for the execution on the emulator.
- __ls__: List the files you uploaded.
- __run [file]__: Execute a file which you uploaded or some files are already
  embedded.
- __help__: Print all commands you can use.

See [the "Build RISC-V binary" section](https://github.com/d0iasm/rvemu#build-risc-v-binary) for more information.

## Build and run on the local browser
The `wasm-pack build` command generates a pkg directory and makes Rust source code into `.wasm` binary. It also generates the JavaScript API for using our Rust-generated WebAssembly. The toolchain's supported target is `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
You need to execute this command whenever you change your Rust code.
```
$ make rvemu-wasm
// This is the alias of `wasm-pack build lib/rvemu-wasm --out-dir <path-to-rvemu>/public/pkg --target web`.
```

This command installs dependencies in the `node_modules` directory. Need `npm install --save` in the `public` directory at the first time and whenever you change dependencies in package.json.
```
$ npm install --save // at the public directory
```

You can see the website via http://localhost:8000. `npm start` is the alias of `python3 -m http.server` so you need Python3 in your environment.
```
$ npm start // at the public directory
```

## Build and run as a CLI tool
The emulator can be executed as a CLI tool too. You can build it by `make rvemu-cli` command which is the alias of `cargo build --release --manifest-path lib/rvemu-cli/Cargo.toml`.

To execute the RISC-V ELF binary, xv6 in the folloing example, you can use `--kernel` or `-k` options to specify the kernel image. Note that `xv6-kernel.text` is an ELF file without headers by the command `riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy -O binary kernel xv6-kernel.text`
```
$ ./target/release/rvemu-cli -k examples/xv6-kernel.text -f examples/xv6-fs.img
```

You can see the details of how to use by the `help` option.
```
$ ./target/release/rvemu-cli --help
rvemu: RISC-V emulator 0.0.1
Asami Doi <@d0iasm>

USAGE:
    rvemu-cli [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] --kernel <kernel>

FLAGS:
    -d, --debug      Enables to output debug messages
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -f, --file <file>        A raw disk image
    -k, --kernel <kernel>    A kernel ELF image without headers
```

## Build RISC-V binary
The emulator starts to execute at the address 0x8000_0000, the start address of DRAM, so you need to extract `.text` section and place it to the address.
```
// Make an assembly file from a C file.
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -S -nostdlib hoge.c
// Make a binary file from an assembly file with start position 0.
$l riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Wl,-Ttext=0x80000000 -nostdlib -o hoge hoge.s
// Extract a text section from a binary file.
$ riscv64-unknown-elf-objcopy -O binary hoge hoge.text
```

## Testing
You can see the binaries for unit testings in [riscv/riscv-tests](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests).
The following command executes all `rv64ua/d/f/i/m-p-*` binaries.
TODO: not all tests are passed for now.
```
$ make test
```

## Analyzing with perf
```
$ perf record -F99 --call-graph dwarf ./target/release/rvemu-cli -k examples/xv6-kernel.text -f examples/xv6-fs.img
$ perf report
```

## Publish
[The site](https://rvemu.app/) is hosted by a firebase.
```
$ firebase deploy
```
