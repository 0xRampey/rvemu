# rvemu
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/d0iasm/rvemu.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/d0iasm/rvemu)  
RISC-V online emulator with WebAssembly generated by Rust. The instruction sets in this emulator complies "The RISC-V Instruction Set ManualVolume I: Unprivileged ISADocument Version 20191213".

__NOTE: This project is currently under intensely development. The source code might be changed dramatically.__

https://riscvemu.web.app/

Supports the following RISC-V ISA features (RV64G):
- RV32I (v2.1): supports 40/40 instructions (FENCE, ECALL, and EBREAK don't do anything for now)
- RV64I (v2.1): supports 12/12 instructions (SLLI, SRLI, and SRAI are included in RV32I)
- RV32M/RV64M (v2.0): supports 13/13 instructions
- RV32A/RV64A (v2.0): supports 22/22 instructions (no unittests and no atomicity)
- RV32F/RV64F (v2.2): supports 30/30 instructions
- RV32D/RV64D (v2.2): supports 32/32 instructions
- Zifencei (v2.0): supports 1/1 instructions (FENCE.i doesn't do anything for now)
- Zicsr (v2.0): supports 6/6 instructions (no unittests and no atomicity)

Supports CSRs:
- mhartid: Hardware thread ID.
- mstatus: Machine status register.
- misa: ISA and extensions.
- medeleg: Machine exception delegation register.
- mideleg: Machine interrupt delegation register.
- mie: Machine interrupt-enable register.
- mtvec: Machine trap-handler base address.
- mepc: Machine exception program coutner.
- mcause: Machine trap cause.
- mip: Machine interrupt pending.

# Usage
The emulator supports the following commands:
- __upload__: Upload a local RISC-V binary/local RISC-V binaries for an execution on the emulator.
- __ls__: List the files you uploaded.
- __run [file]__: Execute a file.
- __help__: Print all commands you can use.

## Build and Run
The `wasm-pack build` command generates a pkg directory and makes Rust source code into `.wasm` binary. It also generates the JavaScript API for using our Rust-generated WebAssembly. The toolchain's supported target is `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
You need to execute this command whenever you change your Rust code.
```
$ wasm-pack build --out-dir public/pkg --target web
```

This command installs dependencies in the `node_modules` directory. Need `npm install --save` in the `public` directory at the first time and whenever you change dependencies in package.json.
```
$ npm install --save // at the public directory
```

You can see the website via http://localhost:8000. `npm start` is the alias of `python3 -m http.server` so you need Python3 in your environment.
```
$ npm start // at the public directory
```

## Test
You need to install a Firefox browser or a Chrome browser to test the project. A browser can be specified by a `--firefox` or a `--chrome` flag.
```
$ wasm-pack test --firefox --headless
```
